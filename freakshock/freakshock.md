# Freakshock Write Up (Lynix API Module) 

> **Motivation**
> 
> Because piShock is expensive and centralized on non opensource servers.  
> It's hard to modify the functionality and it uses a bad HTTP Polling Method to get commands.  
> It's not easely to DIY and you need to buy a DIY Kit licence.
